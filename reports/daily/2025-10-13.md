/home/runner/work/solana/solana/utils/intraday_analyzer.py:151: FutureWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or Series through chained assignment using an inplace method.
The behavior will change in pandas 3.0. This inplace method will never work because the intermediate object on which we are setting values always behaves as a copy.

For example, when doing 'df[col].method(value, inplace=True)', try using 'df.method({col: value}, inplace=True)' or df[col] = df[col].method(value) instead, to perform the operation inplace on the original object.

## 📊 How to Use

### Signal Interpretation
- 🟢 **BUY**: High volatility + positive momentum + volume surge
- 🔴 **SELL**: Momentum reversal or volume decline
- 🟡 **HOLD**: Low volatility or neutral conditions

### Signal Strength
- **0-2**: Weak signal, high risk
- **2-3**: Moderate signal, medium risk
- **3-4**: Strong signal, lower risk
- **4-5**: Very strong signal, best opportunities

### Opportunity Score
Composite score based on:
- Volatility (30%)
- Momentum (30%)
- Volume (20%)
- Signal strength (20%)
- Watchlist bonus (+20 if tracked)

### Recommendations
1. Focus on watchlist tokens (📌) - more reliable data
2. Look for signal strength ≥3.0
3. Confirm with volume momentum
4. Check support/resistance levels before entry
